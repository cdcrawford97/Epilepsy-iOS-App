<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<kbd>
    <img src="/ReadmeImages/Image_1.png" />
</kbd>

The motivation for this project was to provide a mobile app that is free to use, includes the most essential features for a patient who's self-managing their own epilepsy whilst providing a healthcare collobaration feature which I found to be an underdeveloped area in the current epilepsy app market. 

<b>Solution</b>:
* Health communication - separate clinician and patient accounts can be created and linked together to enable the sharing of patient data and thus assist in monitoring the progression of a patient's condition.

* Seizure tracking - the app incorporates a seizure diary, where seizures can be registered based on seizure date, time of occurrence, seizure type, triggers, and duration, with the natural sorting and Ô¨Åltering of seizures by month and year.

* Treatment management - treatments can be added to the app and local notiÔ¨Åcations can be setup for certain days/times as reminders for treatment times.

* Medication adherence - the personalised home screen includes a list of the current treatments that need to be taken that day, as well as displaying relevant statistics relating to seizure count and treatment adherence via a graph and progress bar.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cdcrawford97/Epilepsy-iOS-App
   ```
   
2. Set up a Firebase project to host the application's configuration and data. Please read the guide below.

## Connecting to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

We will need to connect the app with the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). For an in depth explanation, you can read more about [adding Firebase to your iOS Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).

### Here's a summary of the steps!
1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new app.
2. Add an iOS app to the project. Make sure the `Bundle Identifier` you set for this iOS App matches that of the one in this quickstart.
3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` when prompted.
4. Drag the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` into the opened Carerilepsy app. In Xcode, you can also add this file to the project by going to `File`-> `Add Files to 'AuthenticationExample'` and selecting the downloaded `.plist` file. Be sure to add the `.plist` file to the app's main target.
5. At this point, you can build and run the app! üéâ
